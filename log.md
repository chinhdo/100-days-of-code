# 100 Days Of Code - [Chinh](https://github.com/chinhdo) Log

### Day 0: May 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**

* Created from cratch basic Node.js/TypeScript project with Jest, VSCODE debug support.
* Confirmed build, tests, and debug in VSCODE work.

**Thoughts:** 

Working on a limited-scope project for my first day: a Twitter bot that will search for tweets with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode and like a few of them. I want to use this project to re-learn how to set up a new Node.js/TypeScript project with basic features like tests (using Jest), debugging support in VSCODE, etc.

This bot will hopefully help encourage other developers on the #100DaysOfCode journey.

I could not find anything starter project out there for Node.js/TypeScript with working VSCODE debug support. That seems like a useful starter project to have. Maybe I'll create one and share.
