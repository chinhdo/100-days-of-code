# 100 Days Of Code - [Chinh](https://github.com/chinhdo) Log

### Day 0: May 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**

* Created from cratch basic Node.js/TypeScript project with Jest, VSCODE debug support.
* Confirmed build, tests, and debug in VSCODE work.
* Version 1.0 of the app can now search for tweets, and list out 10 recommended tweets for me to review and like. I decided for the bot to recommend tweets instead of liking the tweets itself because:
  * I want to weed out the spam posts.
  * I want to reply to some of the posts and give encouragement to others when appropriate. 
  * It's against Twitter TOS to automatically like tweets :)

**Thoughts:**

Took me way more time than I wanted to spend on setting up a basic Node.js/TypeScript project. Still don't have debug support in Visual Studio Code working. Will work on that later. Compared with the .NET ecosystem, I can create a starter .NET console app with all basic tooling support and get up and running in less than 5 minutes.

I ended up spending way more than 1 hour on coding today. I guess I am feeling a little bit of peer pressure - the good kind :)
